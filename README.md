# Computer Science Fundamentals I - Assignment 3

## Description
In this assignment, you will write a Python module, called sentiment_analysis.py and a main program, main.py, that uses the module to analyze Twitter information. In the module sentiment_analysis.py, you will create a function that will perform simple sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The Twitter data contains comments from individuals about how they feel about their lives and comes from individuals across the continental United States.The objective is to determine which timezone (Eastern,Central,Mountain,Pacific) is the “happiest”. 
- Analyze each individual tweet to determine a score “happiness score”
- The “happiness score” for a single tweet is found by looking for certain keywords (which are given) in a tweet and for each keyword found in that tweet totaling their “sentiment
 values”. In this assignment, each value is an integer from 1 to 10
 - The “happiness score” for a timezone is just the total of the scores for all the counted tweets in that region divided by the number of keyword tweets in that region
